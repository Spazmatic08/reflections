When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    Whenever you want to share code with others, or back your work up on the cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Recall the issues related to merging, and apply them here. Besides, you want to remain
    in control of what changes occur to your code, and you can't do that with an automated
    updating system.
