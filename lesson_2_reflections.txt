What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    When you initialize a repository, the .git file is added to it
    automatically. This signifies that the group of files 
    included are to form a git repository, with all the capabilities
    attributed to it. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

    It's a simple concept to add additional functionality to the use
    of commits. The staging area dictates what changes are stored in
    the next commit, and which are not. It makes it easier to work 
    on multiple issues at once, for one. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?

    Simple - only use the add command on files whose changes you feel
    are ready for a commit.
